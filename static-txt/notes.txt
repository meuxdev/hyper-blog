GIT REBASE NOTES
--------------------------------

1- Go to the branch that you want to disapear.

$ git checkout del-branch


2- Lest think that here we have some commits that are not merged with the main branch.
So we want to paste this commits without changing anything visible on the history of the 
main branch.

On the "del-branch" we need to make the first rebase. To the branch that you want to attach the history
in this case the main branch is the one.

$ git rebase main

Then we should go again to the main branch to paste the changes on the main branch.

$ git checkout main
$ git rebase del-branch

And now the del-branch history is pasted on the main branch with no evidence of the previous existing branch.

Now you can delete the branch.

$ git branch -d del-branch

REMEMBER ITS VERY IMPORTANT TO first make the rebase on the branch to rebase and then on the branch we wanna paset the changes.
