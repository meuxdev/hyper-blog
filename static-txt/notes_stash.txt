GIT STASH
-------------------------------

git stash -> saves the changes that had not been commited on a temporary memory

git stash list -> shows the stash that you have currently. And the last commit.

git stash pop -> brings back the changes like when you did the stash.

git stash drop -> does NOT bring the changes back. It deletes the temp memory. 

git stash branch <nameBranch> -> creates a new branch and applies the pop so that in the new branch the prev.
modifications are visible.
